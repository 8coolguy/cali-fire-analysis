Analysis of the factors that lead to California Fires with different models. 

Work in progress. The data was webscraped from Wundergroud, google map api, and Cal fires using selenium or their apis. Trying to create a prdictive model of California fires. Currently having a bad time. Also looking at the UCI fire predictive paper for tips and tricks. Also playing around with this [repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires) to look for better techniques for analyzing my data.
